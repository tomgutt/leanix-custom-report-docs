> Documentation and examples for building LeanIX Custom Reports.

This repository hosts documentation and code examples for building LeanIX Custom Reports.

- `docs/`: Guides and reference documentation (more topics will be added over time)
- `examples/`: Runnable example projects demonstrating common setups and patterns

## Documentation

- [Repository README](https://github.com/tomgutt/leanix-custom-report-docs#readme): Overview and entry points
- [Docs directory](https://github.com/tomgutt/leanix-custom-report-docs/tree/main/docs): All documentation

## Getting Started

- [Fresh start with create‑lxr](https://github.com/tomgutt/leanix-custom-report-docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/fresh-start.md): If you don't have an existing app, scaffold a new report project. Includes commands to run dev, build, and upload to a LeanIX workspace.
- [Vite plugin guide](https://github.com/tomgutt/leanix-custom-report-docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/vite-plugin.md): Add LeanIX dev/build/upload flows to an existing Vite project.
- [Existing web app (non‑Vite) guide](https://github.com/tomgutt/leanix-custom-report-docs/blob/main/docs/get-started/existing-web-app.md): Integrate the LeanIX reporting runtime without changing your bundler.

Tip: First check whether the project is an existing web app. If yes, use the Vite plugin or existing web app guides. Otherwise use the scaffolding tool (recommended).

## Code Examples
