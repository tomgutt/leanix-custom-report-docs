This repository hosts documentation and code examples for building LeanIX Custom Reports.

- docs/: Guides and reference documentation
- examples/: Runnable example projects demonstrating common setups and patterns

### Get started

Choose the path that fits your situation:

- Fresh start with create-lxr tool: Recommended when you’re not in an existing app.
  - docs/get-started/fresh-start.md
- Vite plugin (vite-plugin-lxr): If you already have a Vite project, add LeanIX dev/build/upload flows.
  - docs/get-started/vite-plugin.md
- Existing web app (non‑Vite): If you have an existing non‑Vite setup, integrate the LeanIX reporting runtime without changing your bundler.
  - docs/get-started/existing-web-app.md

Tip: First check whether you’re working inside an existing web app. If yes, use the Vite plugin or existing web app guides. Otherwise use the scaffolding tool (recommended).
