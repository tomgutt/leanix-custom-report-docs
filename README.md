## LeanIX Custom Reports – Documentation

This repository hosts documentation and code examples for building LeanIX Custom Reports.

- docs/: Guides and reference documentation (more topics will be added over time)
- examples/: Runnable example projects demonstrating common setups and patterns

### Get started

Choose the path that fits your situation:

- Fresh start with create-lxr: Scaffold a new report project with your favorite framework.
  - docs/get-started/fresh-start.md
- Vite plugin (vite-plugin-lxr): Add LeanIX dev/build/upload flows to an existing Vite project.
  - docs/get-started/vite-plugin.md
- Existing web app (non‑Vite): Integrate the LeanIX reporting runtime without changing your bundler.
  - docs/get-started/existing-web-app.md

More guides will be added under docs/ beyond getting started (e.g., configuration, data APIs, deployment, and troubleshooting).
